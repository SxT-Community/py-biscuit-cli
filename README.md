# SxT Python Biscuit CLI

Sometimes you need to quickly generate different biscuits rapidly for testing purposes. Since the release of [Biscuit Python](https://python.biscuitsec.org/) it's become a lot easier to generate Biscuits in Python. The purpose of this tool is to put a simple CLI wrapper around the Biscuit Python library that's modeled specifically for use with Space and Time. 

This is an early work in progress. Please use it with caution! 

```shell
â””â”€[$] python py-biscuit-cli.py --help                                                                                                                                                          [17:22:37]
